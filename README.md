# Py-Chip8
A Chip-8 emulator implemented in python and pygame

## WHAT IS CHIP-8
Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language and virtual machine originally developed in the 1970s for use on early home computers, primarily the Cosmac VIP and Telmac 1800. 
It was designed to be a lightweight and straightforward language to run on hardware with limited resources, particularly for games and simple graphical output.

## WHY EMULATE IT
Chip-8 is the hello world of emulator programming so anyone looking to try their hand at emulation or low level programming should atlleast try it so I did.


## Usage 
``` pip install pygame
git clone https://github.com/ejay0289/Py-Chip8.git
cd Py-Chip8
chip8.py <path to romfile
```

I had a lot of fun working on this and will definitely come back to rework it. Feel free to learn from my code or use it in your own emulator.
